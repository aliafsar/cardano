Update the apt packages repo cache.
This is to be done where ansible will undertake all its work from (Tower) to all the Hosts.

  $ sudo apt update

Install Ansible with following command, if required confirm install by Y.

  $ sudo apt install ansible

Run following command to confirm ansible is working correctly.

  $ ansible --version

Set-up SSH on Tower.  Enter defaults with no passphrase.

  $  ssh-keygen

Configure password-less sudo access to the ansible user

  $ echo "<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/<username>

From Tower to Host (your first host) set-up ssh public keys.  Enter where required.

  $ ssh-copy-id <username>@192.168.1.30

To test passwordless ssh from Tower to Host1

  $ ssh <username>@192.168.1.30


Update /etc/ansible/hosts with your host and user details, example....

[cardano_ALL]
192.168.1.30    ansible_user=<username>
